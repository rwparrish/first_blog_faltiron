What a wild ride it has been. When I tell people that I am making a career change I get a lot of questions. People say, “Wow, that must be scary!” and “What are you doing!?”. When I tell them that I am taking an intensive five month course to learn software engineering, they want to know more about it. I tell them it’s like drinking from a firehose. As I look back at my time after having just completed my final project using React and Redux, I believe I have been using a good metaphor. Upon allowing myself time to reflect further, I must admit this has been one of the most rewarding times in my life. When I first began my journey with Flatiron, I was told that this would be like a rollercoaster. I was told there would be ups and downs. I was warned about the pit of despair. I have been there and now I am here. 

If someone wanted some advice as they are considering such a change in their life, I suppose I would have a few things to share.

1. Don’t rely on emotions alone to keep you going. Emotions come and go. Emotional energy and our emotions change. Also, coding is supposed to be hard and unless you’re one of the few lucky ones that get motivated by frustration, your emotions are not the most consistent source of energy. 

2. Think of your “why”. Why are you bold and courageous enough to make such a change in your life? Why are you facing your fears and trying to learn something that isn’t easy to learn? What is your “why”? Two books I recommend that will prepare for the lows and help you get through them are: “Start with Why” by Simon Sinek and “Can’t Hurt Me” by David Goggins. They are worth your time in my humble opinion.


3. Make the time to reflect on your growth and appreciate what you accomplish as you move through the course. Perhaps, you can make a vision board and add your success to it as you go. These kinds of “bootcamp” programming courses cram tons of info into a short period of time and that can mean there is little time allocated for reflection on growth.


4. Reach out! Reach out! Reach out! Make the effort to be vulnerable and connect with others in the same boat as you. You’ll find that you come away with friendships that last. It helps with stress and you will learn more too. Partner or “paired programming” is a great way to learn and is often what you will be doing in the professional world.


5. Have fun learning! Yes, programming is tough. But, it can also be very fun and exciting. Nurture your creative side. You won’t regret it.

I hope that this advice can service you well on your journey. Remember, on the other side of your fears and suffering is greatness. Do it.
