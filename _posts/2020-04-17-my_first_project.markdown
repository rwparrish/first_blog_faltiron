As I sit down to write this blog post and reflect on the completion of my first project, I can't help but feel a sense of accomplishment. It feels good. It feels like I fell forward many times and somehow wound up with a working program. After three and a half weeks of learning to code full-time, I have built something, with lots of help, but I did it. Maybe that's the point of this post; as a programmer, you gotta get used to the idea that reaching out is the norm. Try your best of course, but try not to be afraid to ask for input from others. It's easy to fall into the trap of feeling stuck, lost and like you've learned nothing to this point when you start your programming journey in a boot camp fashion. There is A LOT of information to absorb in a very short period of time and it can feel like you're not retaining everything you "should" retain. I feel that writing these blog posts is good for me because it gives me a great opportunity to reflect on my recent growth as a programmer and a learner. 

This project gave me my first sense of what it's like to conceptualize your first program, plan it and then actually write the code. Creating a flow chart to visualize how the program should function taught me how to better think like a programmer. It taught me how to plan for input and output, the different functions that I might try to implement and most importantly, it taught me more about thinking like an object-oriented (OO) programmer. Learning to program is hard but it is very rewarding when you see your code work, and it can be fun! In fact, as I write this I find myself thinking about what I could do to build on and improve my project.
